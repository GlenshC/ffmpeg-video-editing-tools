# ffmpeg video editing tools
Personal editing tools, video scene splitter, and shuffler. For getting clips from videos.

This is project is not documented well, as this is just a very niche python scripts for my video editing work.
This is not a CLI API, it involves editing the scripts to run.


Running this tools is like following a step:
1. Run splitScene.py
2. Run group.py
3. Run shuffle.py
